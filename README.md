All team members will work together to plan and design their test cases.
Once the team has finished their Decision Table, BVA, Equivalence Paritioning, etc.
Work can then be separated out to have each member work on writing a few test cases.

The techniques that associates should be employing for this activity are:
 
Exploratory Testing (using similar existing web apps - for example if a team has an e-commerce-themed use case, they can do exploratory testing with websites like Amazon, Barnes & Noble, etc.)
Decision Tables
Boundary Value Analysis
State Transition Diagrams
Equivalence Partitioning
The test cases will not be executed in this activity. The focus is on utilizing and familiarizing oneself with different testing techniques.
